I am Oksana. I got master degree in Applied Math and Physics and PhD in Computer Science (<a href="https://oksana-the-pooh.github.io/files/cv_v3.pdf">CV</a>).

This is my notes about math questions which I am interested in. I find it to be a good idea to have electronic notes. You can accsess it at any time in any place. I do need such notes. The math processes may go in the counterintuitive ways. It is very helpful to deal with them in "talk to teddy bear" manner and write down the conversation. When I face a similar problem again and think "why does it happen that way?", I can open my notes and "ah, that's why". So I am going to deal with every question in details, long, boring, without any steps skipping. When I studied theoretical physics, the books of Landau and Lifshitz (I highly recommend them to everyone who thinks his life is too simple and lighthearted) were my coffee table books. "It is easy to see" is very frequent throughout the books. Since that time I very well know where this is going. The day will pass and night will come while you try to see this “easy”. So there is no "It is easy to see" in these notes!
